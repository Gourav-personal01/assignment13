# MONGODB is the database which store the data on the basis of no relational format and This database follows the NOSQL language.

# Non-relational database is the database which stored any data which is in unstructed format like dictionary object data and Json object data.

# Suppose if me have to store data which is unstructured format like image,video,text etc then in that case we will use mongodb over sql.
